# Rule index for AI-assisted Go project

This file supersedes the earlier stub and points to the canonical rules used by this repository.

Canonical rules

- See [.cursor/rules/go-project-rules.md](.cursor/rules/go-project-rules.md)
- That document consolidates Effective Go, Go Code Review Comments, and Uber Go Style Guide

Highlights

- Dependencies: prefer standard library; justify any third-party addition
- Error handling: return error as last value; no panics for expected failures; wrap with context; handle once
- Concurrency: pass context for cancellation; avoid shared mutable state; keep patterns simple
- Testing: table-driven tests; subtests; keep deterministic; run race detector in CI
- Observability: structured logs; avoid sensitive data; add metrics and tracing hooks where appropriate
- Security: never commit secrets; validate all external inputs; least privilege for processes and credentials

File status

- Original stub [.cursor/rules/rule.mdc](.cursor/rules/rule.mdc) cannot be edited in Architect mode
- This [.cursor/rules/rule.md](.cursor/rules/rule.md) is now the maintained entry point
- Remove or rename the .mdc file in a follow-up change if desired

Usage

- Reference these rules in pull requests by humans or AI agents
- Document any intentional exceptions with rationale in the PR

Ownership
